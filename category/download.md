Data from the ACCDB can be easily downloaded from this website. The dataset can be filtered by taxonomic names or haploid/diploid counts. Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously to the database.

After filters have been applied, a comma-separated values (CSV) file can be exported by clicking on the CSV button above the table.
