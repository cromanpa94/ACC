Welcome to the Animal Chromosome Count Database (**ACC**). The **ACC** is the largest database of animal chromosomal counts. We have curated chromosome numbers across the animal Tree of Life to make data accessible for people interested in understanding the potential links between biological processes and patterns to broad chromosomal changes in animals.
