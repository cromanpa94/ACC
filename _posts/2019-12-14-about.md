Everyone can contribute to the **ACC**. This is a community resource that aims to contain as many chromosome counts as possible from as many animal species as possible. New counts for species already listed in the database are highly encouraged.

The most recent release of the ACCDB includes chromosome counts for ~ 20,000 animal species. We expect that future releases of the **ACC** to (i) increase the number of species with chromosome counts, and (ii) expand the taxonomic breadth of the database to major unsampled groups.
