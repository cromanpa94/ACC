title: "The Animal Chromosome Count database"
---

Welcome to the Animal Chromosome Count Database (**ACC**). The ACC is the largest database of animal chromosal counts. We have curated chromosome numbers across the animal Tree of Life to make data accessible for people interested in understanding the potential links between biological processes and patterns to broad chromosal changes in animals.
