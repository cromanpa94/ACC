Because the **ACC** is a community resource, we rely on your help to improve the quality and quantity of animal chromosome counts. Please, use the link below to submit (i) new counts for existing species, (ii) new counts for species without existing count information, or (iii) new references for existing counts.

We ask that when you submit data to also include your contact information (full name and email address) along with the chromosome count information (scientific name, 2N/N count(s), and reference).

Thank you very much for your contributions!

##### Note: Weâ€™re still working on the user submission platform. Please, use [contact us](/ACC/category/contact) if you have information that you would like to contribute to the database.
