Contributions to the **ACC** are highly encouraged since this is a community resource that aims to provide easy access to chromosome counts for the different animal lineages.

Do not hesitate to use the uploader on this website to submit (i) new counts for existing species, (ii) new counts for currently unsampled species in the ACCDB, or even (iii) new references to existing counts in the database.

We ask you to follow some minimal guidelines before submitting any chromosome counts. We will manually curate any document containing (i) your contact information (full name, email address), and (ii) chromosome counts (Species name, 2N, N, Reference).

An example can be found here:

Please make sure that the file you are about to upload includes both your contact information and chromosome counts.

Thank you so much for your contribution to the **ACC** !
