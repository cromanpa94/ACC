Since the **ACC** is a community resource, contributions are highly encouraged.
Please do not hesitate to use the link below to submit (i) new counts for existing species, (ii) new counts for currently unsampled species in the ACCDB, or even (iii) new references to existing counts in the database.

We ask for some minimal details on any submission: (i) your contact information (full name, email address), and (ii) chromosome counts (Species name, 2N, N, Reference).

Thank you so much for your contributions!

##### We're still working on the user submission plataform. Please use [Contact us](/ACC/category/contact) if you have information that would like to be include into the database.
